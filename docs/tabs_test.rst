    2. Move the downloaded file to any desired folder.
    3. Run the application by double-clicking it.
    4. Enjoy!
    5. Extra lines just to observe effect of height difference between tabs:
    6. abc
    7. xyz
    8. xyzzy
    9. etc.

.. tab:: Ubuntu

    Additional options for Ubuntu:

    .. tab:: 20.04 LTS

        Nested tab for ``Ubuntu 20.04 LTS``

    .. tab:: 22.04

        Nested tab for ``Ubuntu 22.04``

This is text after the tabs, which seems to flow right through. This avoids breaking the flow of the document.
